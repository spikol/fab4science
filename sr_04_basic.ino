/*
 * HC-SR04 Basic Threshold Detection (NO FILTERING)
 * 
 * Demonstrates THE PROBLEM that filtering solves!
 * 
 * This sketch uses a single threshold with no hysteresis or filtering.
 * When an object is near the threshold distance, the LED will flicker
 * rapidly due to sensor noise and small movements.
 * 
 * PROBLEM DEMONSTRATION:
 * - Move your hand slowly around 30cm from the sensor
 * - Watch the LED flicker/flutter rapidly
 * - This happens because raw sensor readings are noisy
 * - Small variations around the threshold cause rapid on/off switching
 * 
 * SOLUTION: Use hysteresis or filtering (see other examples)
 * 
 * Compare this to sr_04_Hysteresis_LED.ino to see the improvement!

/*
 * THE PROBLEM THIS DEMONSTRATES:
 * 
 * Scenario: Hand positioned at exactly 30cm from sensor
 * 
 * Sample readings (typical sensor noise):
 * Reading 1: 29.8 cm â†’ LED ON  âœ“
 * Reading 2: 30.2 cm â†’ LED OFF âœ—
 * Reading 3: 29.9 cm â†’ LED ON  âœ“
 * Reading 4: 30.1 cm â†’ LED OFF âœ—
 * Reading 5: 29.7 cm â†’ LED ON  âœ“
 * Reading 6: 30.3 cm â†’ LED OFF âœ—
 * 
 * Result: LED flickers rapidly! ðŸ˜µ
 * 
 * WHY THIS HAPPENS:
 * 
 * 1. SENSOR NOISE:
 *    - Ultrasonic sensors have ~Â±1cm accuracy
 *    - Electrical noise adds random variations
 *    - Temperature/humidity affect readings
 * 
 * 2. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS:
 *    - Hand isn't perfectly still (micro-movements)
 *    - Air currents affect ultrasonic waves
 *    - Surface angle affects reflections
 * 
 * 3. DIGITAL QUANTIZATION:
 *    - pulseIn() has finite resolution
 *    - Timing variations at microsecond level
 *    - Rounding in distance calculation
 * 
 * REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:
 * 
 * Imagine a room thermostat with a single threshold at 20Â°C:
 * - 19.9Â°C â†’ Heater turns ON
 * - 20.1Â°C â†’ Heater turns OFF
 * - 19.9Â°C â†’ Heater turns ON
 * - 20.1Â°C â†’ Heater turns OFF
 * 
 * The heater would cycle on/off constantly, wearing it out!
 * 
 * SERIAL PLOTTER VIEW:
 * 
 * You'll see three lines:
 * - Blue: Raw distance (noisy, fluctuating)
 * - Red: Threshold line (constant at 30cm)
 * - Green: LED state (flickering between 0 and 40)
 * 
 * Notice how the LED state line rapidly jumps up and down
 * when the distance hovers near the threshold!
 * 
 * EXPERIMENT:
 * 
 * 1. Position hand at ~30cm from sensor
 * 2. Hold as still as possible
 * 3. Watch the LED flicker rapidly
 * 4. Watch Serial Plotter - LED state jumps up/down
 * 5. Now try the hysteresis example for comparison
 * 
 * With hysteresis (sr_04_Hysteresis_LED.ino):
 * - Two thresholds: 20cm and 40cm
 * - LED stays stable in the 20-40cm "dead zone"
 * - No flickering!
 * 
 * SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM:
 * 
 * 1. HYSTERESIS (best for binary state):
 *    - Use two thresholds (low and high)
 *    - Creates a "dead zone" between them
 *    - State only changes when crossing thresholds
 *    â†’ See: sr_04_Hysteresis_LED.ino
 * 
 * 2. MEDIAN FILTER (removes spikes):
 *    - Takes middle value of recent samples
 *    - Eliminates single outlier readings
 *    â†’ See: sr_04_median.ino
 * 
 * 3. MOVING AVERAGE (smooths signal):
 *    - Averages multiple recent samples
 *    - Reduces random noise
 *    â†’ See: sr_04_moving_average.ino
 * 
 * 4. LOW-PASS FILTER (frequency-based):
 *    - Blocks high-frequency noise
 *    - Preserves slow movements
 *    â†’ See: sr_04_low_pass.ino
 * 
 * 5. DEBOUNCING (count-based):
 *    - Require N consecutive readings before changing state
 *    - Simple software solution
 * 
 * KEY LESSON:
 * 
 * Raw sensor data is rarely suitable for direct control!
 * Always apply appropriate filtering or hysteresis to:
 * - Reduce noise
 * - Prevent rapid switching
 * - Improve system stability
 * - Extend actuator lifetime (relays, motors, etc.)
 * 
 * This sketch intentionally demonstrates BAD practice
 * to highlight why filtering is essential! 
 * 
 * NEXT STEPS:
 * 
 * 1. Run this sketch and observe the flickering
 * 2. Try sr_04_Hysteresis_LED.ino - see stable LED
 * 3. Compare Serial Plotter outputs
 * 4. Experiment with different filter types
 * 
 * Remember: Good signal processing is invisible!
 * When done right, the system "just works" smoothly.
