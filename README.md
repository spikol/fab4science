## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/signal-processing-sr04.git
   ```

2. **Open Arduino IDE**
   - File ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Select any `sr_04_*.ino` example

3. **Upload to Arduino**
   - Connect your Arduino via USB
   - Select correct board and port
   - Click Upload

4. **View Results**
   - Tools ‚Üí Serial Plotter (or Serial Monitor)
   - Watch the real-time filter output!

### Recommended Learning Path

1. **Start with `sr_04_simple_plot.ino`**
   - Understand raw sensor behavior
   - Observe noise and variability

2. **Try `sr_04_basic_threshold.ino`**
   - See the problem: LED flickering!
   - Understand why filtering is needed

3. **Explore individual filters**
   - Low-pass: Smoothing
   - Median: Spike removal
   - Moving average: Simple noise reduction
   - Hysteresis: Stable switching

4. **Advanced examples**
   - High-pass: Motion detection
   - Band-pass: Periodic signal extraction

## üìä Understanding the Output

### Serial Plotter Format

All examples output data in Serial Plotter compatible format:
```
Value1,Value2,Value3
```

This creates multiple traces for easy comparison between raw and filtered signals.

### Typical Plots

- **Raw signal**: Noisy, fluctuating line
- **Filtered signal**: Smooth, stable line
- **Reference lines**: Thresholds or zero crossings

### Which Filter Should I Use?

| Smooth noisy readings | Low-pass or Moving Average | `sr_04_low_pass.ino` |
| Detect motion/changes | High-pass | `sr_04_high_pass.ino` |
| Remove occasional spikes | Median | `sr_04_median.ino` |
| Extract rhythmic motion | Band-pass | `sr_04_band_pass.ino` |

## üî¨ Experiments to Try

### 1. Comparing Filter Behavior
- Run different examples with the same hand motion
- Compare response time and smoothness
- Which filter best suits your application?

### 2. Parameter Tuning
- Modify `WINDOW_SIZE` in moving average
- Adjust thresholds in hysteresis example
- Change cutoff frequencies (requires filter_gen.py)

### 3. Real-World Applications
- **Parking sensor**: Use hysteresis for stable distance warning
- **Motion detector**: Use high-pass to trigger on movement
- **Gesture recognition**: Use band-pass to detect waving
- **Presence detection**: Use low-pass for stable occupancy sensing

### 4. Noise Analysis
- Compare raw vs filtered signal variance
- Count false triggers with and without filtering
- Measure response delay for different filters

## üìñ Key Concepts

### Frequency Domain Thinking

- **Low frequency** = Slow changes (trends, actual distance)
- **High frequency** = Fast changes (noise, vibration)

### Sampling Rate

All examples use **10 Hz** sampling (one reading every 100ms). This is important because:
- Filter designs are matched to this rate
- Nyquist frequency is 5 Hz (can detect up to this frequency)
- Changing the delay affects filter performance

### IIR vs FIR Filters

- **IIR** (Infinite Impulse Response): Low-pass, high-pass, band-pass examples
  - Uses feedback (previous outputs)
  - Very efficient (minimal memory)
  - Based on analog filter designs
  
- **FIR** (Finite Impulse Response): Moving average example
  - No feedback (only past inputs)
  - More memory required
  - Simpler to understand

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Serial Output
- Check baud rate: Should be 115200
- Verify USB connection
- Check board and port selection

### Erratic Readings
- Ensure sensor is powered properly (5V)
- Check wiring connections
- Avoid reflective or angled surfaces
- Keep sensor steady during testing

### Filter Not Working
- Verify sampling rate matches design (100ms delay)
- Check that static variables aren't being reset
- Ensure proper function call placement in loop()
